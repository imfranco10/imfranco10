I've been down, in the darkest night
Felt like I'd never see the light
But I rose up, with a burning fire
Determined to reach my highest desire

I'm starting over, from the ground
No more chains, no more fear around
I'll break free, from the weights that bind
Gonna shine, leave the past behind

I've been held back, by the voices loud
Told me I'd fail, that I'd never be proud
But I learned to stand, on my own two feet
And now I walk, where my heart beats

I'm starting over, from the ground
No more chains, no more fear around
I'll break free, from the weights that bind
Gonna shine, leave the past behind

I won't be held down, by what they say
I'll rise above, in my own way
No more dependence, on their approval rate
I'll find my strength, in my own create

I'm starting over, from the ground
No more chains, no more fear around
I'll break free, from the weights that bind
Gonna shine, leave the past behind

I'll keep on rising, from the ashes high
With every step, I'll never say die
My voice will echo, through the night
I'm starting over, and I'm feeling alive.
